Legacies v1.4.0

Thank you all so much for the support. With Legacies 1.4, it's safe to say that this project of 1+ years and several hundred hours has finally come together, as one unparralelled, unique and coherent experience. I truly hope you all enjoy.

WARNING: may break older worlds - either stick on an older version or backup before updating. Sorry about this, but breaking changes were necessary for long-term improvements and stability, and will not happen again.

What's New

- a ton of everything. I've spent several dozen hours, if not more, on this update alone. Hence the slight wait.

- reimagined enchanting system - expererience an all-new system for enchanting and repairing, faithful to the vanilla design. This includes a custom enchant book loot rework across all structures, vanilla and modded

- updated, improved, reworked or expanded pretty much everything already in the modpack and base game - everything's been improved

- completely reworked and updated literally every aspect of the game with a meticulous amount of integration and custom tuning. This won't feel like just a modpack - this will feel like one, coherent and whole game.

- the Legacies Wiki! Check it out here: https://legacies.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page

- overhauled overworld worldgen. New biomes, custom, fine-tuned biome reworks, hours of integration on the smallest things between each and evey mod. This is truly Minecraft at its best, with unmatched levels of custom content and integration for a vanilla-like style.

- completely reworked and expanded custom datapacks, configs etc. I spent dozens if not hundreds of hours on this, do not underestimate the difference it makes - as I've stated already, the sheer level of consistency, quality, custom integration and more, in all aspects, from worldgen to gameplay content, is simply unmatched

- reworked nether generation and structures

- end updates and waystone reworks - they now function as a rare, unbreakable end structure as a unique way to set-up base in the end, and can be crafted with the hard-to-acquire Remnant should you wish to bring one home

- VR, controller and global multiplayer support!

- major updates for Legacies and Legends (with the new Nature's Melody), Progression Reborn and the all-new End Reborn

- Charm on 1.20! Dynamic Trims! Improved optimisation! Reworked menus! Updated progression! New music and unique, fitting structures! So many things to list

- without further ado, let's get onto the mod changes changelog. Due to the scope of this update, this changelog doesn't accurately reflect the update - you can pretty much treat this as a "2.0", or whole new pack. It's a massive evolution on the existing game, so reading which mods were technically added/removed won't accurately reflect the updated experience alone. It moreso exists as a dev changelog of major mod changes, as content changes aren't well reflected in the below logs
