# Legacy License
All Rights Reserved unless otherwise specified. Parts of some projects may contain work under different licenses (with permission from the author), so please reach out to me if you have any questions.

Useage of code and assets is permitted purely for compatability with other (not-modpack-specific) mods (provided it remains freely, exclusivley hosted within the same Modrinth/CurseForge ecosystem), with prior permission being optional. If prior permission is not recieved, I reserve the right to request deletion of the project at my own descretion, unless I have been notified and directly provided explicit permission. In addition, you may not claim any work originally taken from any of my projects as your own.

In most cases, I am more than happy to provide irrevokable, complete permission to use my work for a large variety of circumstances. The above notice plays it safe, and is moreso a way to allow others to access my work to a certain extent without having to reach out to me directly. I made this license to keep most of my projects under ARR while making it clear that I am open to and encouraging of other people reaching out to me for related reasons - please feel free to do so!
